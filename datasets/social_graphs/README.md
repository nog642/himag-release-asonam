available by the Stanford Network Analysis Project at
[snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Pokec.html](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Pokec.html).

The **LiveJournal social graph** was also created by processing the raw graph
made available by the Stanford Network Analysis Project at
[snap.stanford.edu/data/com-LiveJournal.html](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/com-LiveJournal.html).
